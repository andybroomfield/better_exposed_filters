Better Exposed Filters
======================

Replaces the Views' default single-select or multi-select elements with radio
buttons or checkboxes, respectively.

Views Filters are a powerful tool to limit the results of a given view. When you
expose a filter, you allow the user to interact with the view making it easy to
build a customized advanced search. For example, exposing a taxonomy filter lets
your site visitor search for articles with specific tags.  Better Exposed
Filters gives you greater control over the rendering of exposed filters.
